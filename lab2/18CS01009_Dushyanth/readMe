Steps to execute the program:
1.  g++ LexicalAnalyzer.cpp
2.  a.exe

There are 7 functions IF,THEN,ELSE,NUMBER,ID,WS,RELOP corresponding to if,then,else,number,identifier,whitespaces,relational operators respectively.
These functions denote the transition diagrams for each token type except 'WS', which is used to handle the whitespaces in a statement.

To identify tokens correctly, a preference order is followed:
(top to bottom ==> decreasing preference)
1. IF
2. ELSE
3. THEN
4. RELOP
5. ID
6. NUMBER
The input is sent sequentially through above 6 functions until a token is recognized.
If none of the 6 functions recognize a token at current index then the input will contain a invalid token entered(e.g. 123.45.6E-9).
In this case a 'invalid input'-message is printed to the terminal.

The transition diagrams are implemented using 'switch' and a state variable.

The outputs for sample input are in 'examples.docx' file.
