Steps to run the program:(on windows)
    1. g++ RE2NFA.cpp
    2. a.exe
    
The program can take Regular expression with atmost 26 elements in its alphabet.
A MACRO named 'COUNT' is defined in the program that specifies the number of elements in the alphabet.

Operations:
    1. '|' : denotes union of two regular expressions e.g a|b
    2. '&' : denotes concatenation of two regular expressions e.g a&b
    3. '+' : denotes one or more occurances of a regular expression e.g a+

Sample inputs:
1. P (denotes phi)
2. E (denotes epsilon)
3. a|b
4. a&b
5. a+
6. regular expression for even length strings of a,b: ((a|b)&(a|b))+
7. (a&b+a)+
8. (a|b)+
